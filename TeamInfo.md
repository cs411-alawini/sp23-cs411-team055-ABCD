## Project Summary

Our project is to basically fetch data from the LAPD website regarding crime committed in Los Angeles. We plan on utilizing the database made available to us by the government of Los Angeles, which is an open website available to everyone - data.lacity.org. We plan on using details like date, time, area, and type of crime to help the people of LA determine and pinpoint areas of repeated crimes. We plan on fetching all data from the year 2010 to the current time with the exception of 2019 due to the lack of data regarding the year. This will be done using two separate datasets, which we will be unioning to achieve a bigger more detailed record of crimes. 

When it comes to functionality, the users will be able to do anything ranging from checking the details on a specific time to being able to compare separate years. We plan on implementing a map that shows people what areas to avoid at what specific times by looking at the frequency of crime in the past. We believe that comparing two yearsâ€™ of crimes will provide all viewers insight into the changes in trends between any two years. This website will be a very useful resource to not only the citizens but the police as well because they will really be able to track all the trends. This will help them see how the trends have changed with time and what areas have become more or less prone to crime, and it will help the LAPD pinpoint these locations and act on them accordingly.
